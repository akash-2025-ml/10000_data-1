Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D7533,Warning,0.75,Email contains executable attachment with high exfiltration behavior score (0.62) indicating potential data theft capability. Despite passing SPF/DKIM authentication legitimate sender indicators authentication may be compromised. No specific request type detected but executable content poses security risk requiring user caution.
D7534,Malicious,0.90,Email exhibits classic phishing characteristics with gift card request type combined with failed SPF/DKIM authentication indicating sender spoofing. Domain reputation score of 0.59 suggests compromised or suspicious sending infrastructure. Authentication failures with social engineering request type represents clear malicious intent.
D7535,Spam,0.70,Email contains meeting request with multiple links (4) and DKIM policy issues suggesting potential spam campaign. While SPF passes the combination of meeting request type with authentication inconsistencies and link volume indicates unsolicited or suspicious meeting invitations commonly used in spam operations.
D7536,No Action,0.85,Email shows minimal threat indicators with very low reputation scores domain confidence and authentication issues. Failed SPF suggests some sender verification problems but absence of specific request types executable content or high-risk behavioral patterns indicates normal email requiring no security action.
D7537,Spam,0.85,Email exhibits high spam content score (0.90) with significant metadata suspicious indicators (0.66) and moderate AMSI suspicion score (0.39). Authentication failures across SPF and DMARC with only DKIM passing suggest compromised or suspicious sender.
