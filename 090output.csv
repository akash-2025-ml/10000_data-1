Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D7883,No Action,0.95,Low risk profile with minimal suspicious indicators. All malicious flags are negative (sender not known malicious, no malicious attachments, no executable files, no exploit patterns). Authentication shows DMARC pass, SPF pass, valid TLS 1.2 encryption. Legal threat request type with very low content spam score and good sender reputation indicates legitimate legal communication.
D7884,Warning,0.82,Mixed authentication signals require caution. While sender domain has low reputation score and SPF/DMARC failures indicate potential spoofing concerns, no direct malicious indicators present. Document download request type with moderate reply path reputation suggests possible phishing attempt but lacks definitive malicious markers. Warrants user awareness and verification.
D7885,Malicious,0.88,Multiple high-risk indicators present. Moderate behavioral sandbox score (0.2) and high exfiltration behavior score (0.67) indicate malicious runtime activity. Gift card request type is classic BEC attack vector. Combined with 5 IOCs detected and suspicious string entropy patterns, this represents clear threat requiring immediate blocking.
D7886,Malicious,0.91,Dangerous combination of malicious signals detected. High content spam score (0.73), unscannable attachment present, and macro-enabled document with elevated AMSI suspicion score (0.3) and exfiltration behavior (0.64) indicate advanced malware. High temporary email likelihood and wire transfer request confirm malicious intent requiring immediate action.
D7887,Warning,0.78,Authentication failures present significant concern. Multiple failed authentication checks (SPF fail, DKIM fail, DMARC fail) combined with urgent callback request type and high temporary email likelihood suggest potential phishing or social engineering attempt. SSL certificate validity issues and moderate content spam score warrant user caution.
D7888,Malicious,0.94,Extremely dangerous threat profile detected. High sender domain reputation score (0.6) but return path known malicious flag set indicates sophisticated spoofing.
