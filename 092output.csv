Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D7983,Spam,0.85,Email shows strong spam indicators: high temporary email likelihood (0.465), SPF failure, DKIM pass but DMARC fail, very low content spam score, and no specific request type. The sender domain has very low reputation. No malicious attachments or URLs detected. TLS 1.1 is outdated but not inherently malicious. The combination suggests bulk spam rather than targeted attack.
D7984,Malicious,0.92,Strong malicious indicators: sender_domain_known_malicious=1, very high temporary email likelihood (0.951), domain extremely low reputation, sensitive_data_request type, SPF pass but DMARC permerror, 4 URLs detected with self-signed SSL certificate. The sensitive data request combined with malicious domain and poor authentication makes this a clear phishing attempt.
D7985,Warning,0.78,Mixed signals present: DMARC enforced (positive), but has meeting_request type with moderate behavioral sandbox score (0.189), AMSI score (0.040), and 4 suspicious strings. SPF pass but DKIM fail. Self-signed SSL certificate on links. The meeting request with suspicious attachment behavior warrants caution but isn't definitively malicious.
D7986,Spam,0.81,High spam likelihood: temporary email probability (0.326), moderate metadata suspicious score (0.449), high reply path reputation score variation, no specific request type, SPF/DKIM pass but no DMARC. Content spam score low but marketing keywords detected (0.683). Pattern indicates promotional spam rather than malicious intent.
D7987,No Action,0.75,Legitimate email indicators: very low temporary email likelihood, good sender reputation, SPF fail but DKIM policy and DMARC fail (configuration issue), no malicious attachments or suspicious behavior, valid SSL certificate. No request type specified. Authentication issues appear to be technical rather than malicious.
D7988,Malicious,0.88,Clear malicious indicators: high metadata suspicious score (0.721), very high exfiltration behavior score (0.953), legal_threat request type, SPF fail, self-signed SSL certificate. Legal threats are common phishing tactics. The combination of behavioral indicators and social engineering strongly suggests malicious intent.
D7989,Warning,0.72,Suspicious but not definitively malicious: moderate metadata suspicious score (0.448), 2 YARA matches, high exfiltration score (0.787), long sandbox execution time (9.55s), link_click request type with 4 URLs. SPF fail but valid SSL. The behavioral indicators suggest potentially unwanted behavior requiring caution.
D7990,Malicious,0.91,Strong phishing indicators: bank_detail_update request type (critical), high reply path reputation issues, SPF fail, URL shortener detected, self-signed SSL certificate. Bank detail update requests are classic BEC/phishing tactics. Despite no malicious attachments, the social engineering aspect makes this highly dangerous.
D7991,Warning,0.76,Mixed signals: VPN/MFA reset request (suspicious), very high AMSI score (0.935), moderate exfiltration score (0.607), but good domain reputation and valid SSL with certificate mismatch. VPN/MFA resets can be legitimate but combined with behavioral scores warrant verification.
D7992,Malicious,0.94,Multiple malicious indicators: packer_detected=1, return_path_known_malicious=1, wire_transfer request type, high behavioral scores, SPF fail, self-signed SSL certificate. Wire transfer requests with packed attachments and known malicious paths are textbook financial fraud attempts.
D7993,Malicious,0.89,Clear malicious pattern: document_download request with final_url_known_malicious=1, moderate behavioral sandbox score (0.169), high sender domain reputation (0.912) used for credibility. The malicious final URL destination confirms this as a phishing/malware delivery attempt despite good authentication.
D7994,No Action,0.71,Benign indicators: very low risk scores across all metrics, no specific request type, good authentication (SPF/DKIM pass), valid SSL, no suspicious attachments or behaviors. Low sender reputation but no malicious indicators. Appears to be legitimate low-priority communication.
D7995,Spam,0.79,Spam characteristics: sensitive_data_request type but with high sender domain reputation (0.906), content marked as spam (0.103), valid SSL. No malicious attachments or behaviors. The sensitive data request seems to be poorly targeted spam rather than sophisticated phishing.
D7996,Malicious,0.87,Malicious indicators: domain_known_malicious=1, moderate metadata suspicious score (0.374), meeting_request type with SSL certificate mismatch, SPF fail. Known malicious domain attempting to schedule meetings is a spear-phishing tactic for credential theft or malware delivery.
D7997,Warning,0.74,Suspicious elements: 2 YARA matches, high behavioral sandbox score (0.438), AMSI score (0.348), is_high_risk_role_targeted=1, but no specific request type and valid SSL. High-value target with suspicious attachment behavior requires careful review.
D7998,Spam,0.76,Spam profile: moderate sender domain reputation (0.509), high spam content score (0.366), no request type, SPF fail but valid SSL. No malicious attachments or concerning behaviors. Pattern consistent with bulk unsolicited email rather than targeted attack.
D7999,Warning,0.80,Mixed threat indicators: high exfiltration score (0.973), legal_threat request type, moderate AMSI score (0.168), content spam score (0.330), but valid SSL and no malicious domains. Legal threats with data exfiltration behaviors suggest possible scareware or fraudulent legal notice.
D8000,Warning,0.77,Concerning signals: DMARC enforced but high behavioral sandbox score (0.706), link_click request, valid SSL. The enforcement of DMARC suggests legitimate sender but sandbox behavior is concerning. Could be compromised legitimate account or sophisticated attack.
D8001,Spam,0.83,Clear spam: very high temporary email likelihood (0.931), bank_detail_update request but no malicious attachments, valid SSL, SPF fail. The bank update request from temporary email is likely spam/scam but lacks sophisticated attack indicators.
D8002,No Action,0.73,Mostly benign: moderate behavioral scores, VPN/MFA reset request, but good authentication and valid SSL. Single embedded file with low risk scores. VPN/MFA requests can be legitimate IT communications. No strong malicious indicators present.
D8003,Malicious,0.95,Highly malicious: return_path_known_malicious=1, wire_transfer request, any_exploit_pattern_detected=1, 2 YARA matches, high behavioral scores, self-signed SSL. Wire transfer with exploit patterns and known malicious infrastructure is critical financial fraud attempt.
D8004,Warning,0.79,Suspicious profile: high AMSI score (0.741), document_download request, 4 URLs, valid SSL but content shows moderate risk. Document downloads can be legitimate but AMSI detection suggests potentially malicious macros or scripts.
D8005,Spam,0.77,Spam indicators: high reply_path_reputation issues (0.895), no specific request type, valid SSL, minimal risk scores otherwise. SPF fail and DMARC fail suggest spoofing attempt but lacks malicious payload. Likely bulk spam operation.
D8006,Warning,0.82,Concerning elements: sensitive_data_request, link_rewritten_through_redirector=1, self-signed SSL, high content spam score (0.599). Sensitive data requests through redirectors with poor SSL suggest phishing but token validation success indicates some legitimacy.
D8007,No Action,0.70,Legitimate profile: high sender domain reputation (0.855), meeting_request, is_high_risk_role_targeted=1, valid SSL, good authentication. High-value target but all other indicators suggest legitimate business communication.
D8008,Malicious,0.90,Malicious indicators: packer_detected=1, high behavioral sandbox score (0.779), image_only_email=1, SSL certificate mismatch. Image-only emails with packed attachments are common malware delivery methods to evade text-based detection.
D8009,Warning,0.75,Mixed signals: domain_tech_stack_match_score=1 (suspicious), high content spam score (0.678), image_only_email=1, but valid SSL and no request type. Image-only format with tech stack mismatch suggests possible phishing but lacks clear malicious intent.
D8010,Malicious,0.96,Critical malicious indicators: 2 malicious_attachment_count, has_executable_attachment=1, legal_threat request, high content spam score (0.819), valid SSL. Executable attachments with legal threats are ransomware/malware patterns. Despite good SSL, the payload is clearly malicious.
D8011,Warning,0.76,Suspicious elements: high behavioral sandbox score (0.790), link_click request, valid SSL but concerning sandbox behavior. No malicious domains but behavioral analysis suggests potentially unwanted activity in clicked links.
D8012,Spam,0.80,Spam characteristics: bank_detail_update request, moderate sender reputation (0.639), valid SSL, 4 URLs. Bank update requests without strong authentication or malicious indicators suggest low-sophistication scam attempts rather than targeted attacks.
D8013,Warning,0.78,Mixed indicators: VPN/MFA reset request with embedded file, self-signed SSL, 4 URLs, but moderate risk scores. VPN/MFA resets with poor SSL security could be credential harvesting but lacks definitive malicious markers.
D8014,Warning,0.81,Concerning profile: reply_path_known_malicious=1, wire_transfer request, embedded file, but low behavioral scores and valid SSL. Wire transfers from known malicious reply paths are suspicious but lack of other indicators suggests possible false positive or early-stage attack.
D8015,Spam,0.79,Spam profile: document_download request, embedded file, high content spam score (0.485), valid SSL. Document downloads without malicious indicators or high behavioral scores suggest spam distribution rather than targeted malware.
D8016,Spam,0.74,Marketing spam: unsubscribe_link_present=1, high marketing score (0.860), valid SSL, no request type. Clear marketing email with unsubscribe option. Not malicious but unsolicited commercial email.
D8017,Malicious,0.93,Critical indicators: sender_known_malicious=1, DMARC enforced, sensitive_data_request, 2 URLs, url_shortener_detected=1, expired SSL certificate. Known malicious sender requesting sensitive data with URL shorteners and expired certificates is definitive phishing attack.
D8018,Warning,0.83,Mixed threat profile: return_path_known_malicious=1, meeting_request, high content spam score (0.865), but valid SSL and good DMARC. Known malicious return path attempting meeting requests suggests BEC attempt but lacks other strong indicators.
D8019,No Action,0.72,Benign profile: high behavioral sandbox score (0.912) but no request type, valid SSL, good authentication. High sandbox score could be false positive without corroborating malicious indicators. Appears legitimate despite behavioral anomaly.
D8020,No Action,0.69,Low risk: no specific request type, valid SSL, good authentication, no malicious indicators. Moderate spam content but lacks any concerning security signals. Likely legitimate email with some spam-like characteristics.
D8021,Warning,0.84,Suspicious indicators: legal_threat request, expired SSL certificate, high URL reputation issues (0.582), but low behavioral scores. Legal threats with expired certificates suggest scareware but lacks sophisticated attack markers.
D8022,Malicious,0.88,Malicious profile: reply_path_diff_from_sender=1, domain_known_malicious=1, link_click request, valid SSL but mismatched reply path with known malicious domain. Classic phishing setup with credential harvesting intent.
D8023,Spam,0.78,Spam indicators: bank_detail_update request, high marketing keywords (0.858), valid SSL but concerning request type. Bank updates without other malicious indicators suggest low-sophistication spam scam.
D8024,Warning,0.85,Complex threat: high metadata suspicious score (0.602), VPN/MFA reset request, url_shortener_detected=1, but valid SSL. VPN/MFA resets with URL shorteners and suspicious metadata strongly suggest credential phishing attempt.
D8025,Malicious,0.91,Critical signals: wire_transfer request, final_url_known_malicious=1, high temporary email likelihood (0.579), html_text_ratio=1.0 (suspicious), valid SSL. Wire transfers to known malicious URLs are definitive fraud attempts.
D8026,Warning,0.79,Suspicious profile: document_download request, high content spam score (0.803), embedded file, valid SSL. Document downloads with high spam scores suggest potentially unwanted content but lacks definitive malicious markers.
D8027,Warning,0.82,Mixed indicators: smtp_ip_known_malicious=1, unsubscribe_link_present=1, valid SSL. Known malicious SMTP infrastructure with unsubscribe links suggests compromised marketing platform or spam operation.
D8028,Warning,0.86,Concerning signals: sensitive_data_request, expired SSL certificate, high spam content (0.264), 4 URLs. Sensitive data requests with expired certificates are strong phishing indicators despite lack of other malicious markers.
D8029,Malicious,0.89,Malicious profile: unscannable_attachment_present=1, url_count=3 (suspicious), meeting_request, self-signed SSL. Unscannable attachments that evade analysis with meeting requests suggest malware delivery attempting to bypass security.
