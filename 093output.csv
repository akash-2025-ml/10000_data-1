Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D8033,Malicious,0.90,Link_click request with high behavioral sandbox score (0.619), high AMSI score (0.366), extremely high exfiltration score (0.990), YARA match, and very long sandbox execution time (88.4s) indicating time-delayed payload. Combined behavioral indicators strongly suggest malware despite valid SSL.
D8034,No Action,0.73,Bank_detail_update request but with very low risk scores across all metrics. Good sender reputation, valid SSL, no suspicious attachments or behaviors. The bank update request appears to be legitimate communication with proper security measures.
D8035,Malicious,0.88,VPN/MFA reset request with any_exploit_pattern_detected=1, high exfiltration score (0.774), expired SSL certificate. VPN/MFA reset combined with exploit patterns is a clear credential harvesting attempt.
D8036,Warning,0.79,Wire_transfer request with any_active_x_objects_detected=1, high exfiltration score (0.893), embedded file. ActiveX controls in wire transfer requests are suspicious but good authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC pass) reduces confidence of malicious intent.
D8037,Malicious,0.93,Document_download request with extremely high metadata suspicious score (0.983), high AMSI score (0.444), high exfiltration score (0.706), url_redirect_chain_length=1, and high url_rendering_behavior_score (0.988). Clear malware delivery attempt.
