Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D8133,No Action,0.71,Bank_detail_update request with low risk scores across all metrics. Expired SSL certificate but valid authentication (softfail SPF, policy DKIM, pass DMARC). No malicious attachments or suspicious behaviors. Appears to be legitimate bank communication with technical SSL issues.
D8134,Malicious,0.88,VPN/MFA reset request with unscannable_attachment_present=1, high behavioral sandbox score (0.702), high AMSI score (0.555), 2 embedded files, SSL certificate mismatch. Unscannable attachments that evade analysis combined with VPN/MFA requests strongly indicate credential harvesting.
D8135,Malicious,0.92,Wire_transfer request with 5 YARA matches, high behavioral sandbox score (0.529), high exfiltration score (0.676), self-signed SSL certificate, very high site visual similarity score (0.854), link_rewritten_through_redirector=1. Multiple YARA matches with brand impersonation in wire transfers are definitive fraud.
D8136,Spam,0.84,Document_download request with reply_path_known_malicious=1, is_high_risk_role_targeted=1, very high temporary email likelihood (0.834), high content spam score (0.790), expired SSL. High temporary email with spam scores suggests bulk spam rather than targeted attack despite reply path issues.
D8137,No Action,0.69,No request type, very low risk scores, valid SSL, good authentication. Minor issues with SPF/DKIM failures but no malicious indicators. Legitimate email with configuration issues.
D8138,No Action,0.73,Sensitive_data_request with moderate temporary email likelihood (0.353) but very low risk scores otherwise. Valid SSL and good authentication. Appears to be legitimate request despite sensitive nature.
D8139,Warning,0.82,Meeting_request with 2 YARA matches, high content spam score (0.958), unsubscribe_link_present=1, moderate metadata suspicious score (0.247). YARA matches in meeting requests warrant investigation despite unsubscribe link presence.
D8140,Malicious,0.86,No request type but has_executable_attachment=1, any_macro_enabled_document=1, high behavioral sandbox score (0.447), very high exfiltration score (0.727). Macro-enabled executable attachments with high behavioral scores indicate malware.
D8141,Malicious,0.89,Sender_known_malicious=1 with very high smtp_ip_reputation_score (0.908), marketing-keywords_detected=1. Known malicious senders are definitive threat indicators regardless of other signals.
D8142,Warning,0.76,Legal_threat request with high exfiltration score (0.747), but low behavioral scores and valid SSL. Legal threats are common phishing tactics but lower severity indicators suggest less sophisticated attempt.

D8148,No Action,0.70,No request type, low risk scores, valid SSL, but SPF/DKIM/DMARC all fail. Authentication failures alone without malicious indicators suggest configuration issues rather than threats.
D8149,Malicious,0.88,Sensitive_data_request with reply_path_known_malicious=1, smtp_ip_known_malicious=1, high content spam score (0.658). Multiple malicious infrastructure indicators with sensitive data requests confirm phishing.
D8150,Warning,0.80,Meeting_request with very high content spam score (0.930), long sandbox execution time (49.6s), self-signed SSL certificate. Time-delayed behavior with high spam scores suggests potential spear-phishing but lacks definitive indicators.

D8155,Spam,0.78,Bank_detail_update request with unsubscribe_link_present=1, 4 URLs, but low risk scores otherwise. Bank updates with unsubscribe links suggest spam scams rather than targeted attacks.
D8156,Malicious,0.87,VPN/MFA reset request with extremely high metadata suspicious score (0.786), extremely high exfiltration score (0.912), high reply path reputation issues (0.612). Multiple high-severity indicators in VPN/MFA requests confirm credential harvesting.
D8157,Malicious,0.94,Sender_known_malicious=1, return_path_known_malicious=1, bank_detail_update request with extremely high temporary email likelihood (0.917), high content spam score (0.801), expired SSL. Multiple malicious sender indicators confirm financial fraud.

D8168,Spam,0.79,Bank_detail_update request with very high reply path reputation issues (0.832), 4 URLs, expired SSL certificate, high smtp_ip_reputation_score (0.598). Poor sender reputation with bank updates suggests spam scam.
D8169,No Action,0.73,VPN/MFA reset request with unscannable_attachment_present=1, reply_path_diff_from_sender=1, but valid SSL and very low behavioral scores. Unscannable attachment appears to be configuration issue rather than evasion.
D8170,Warning,0.82,Wire_transfer request with embedded file, high content spam score (0.406), valid SSL, high smtp_ip_reputation issues (0.806). Wire transfers require scrutiny despite valid SSL.
